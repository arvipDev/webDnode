Installing node using snap - Check node snap website for latest stable version and its cmd to install - https://snapcraft.io/node
1) sudo snap install node --classic
2) node --version - To get node version
3) npm --version - To get npm version
4) sudo snap remove node - To uninstall node (npm as well)

Node.js is an event driven, non-blocking I/O model, single threaded javascript runtime that uses Google's V8 engine to run javascript code on the server.

in terminal - 
1) node (enter to enter node)
2) Tab (twice) to show all node modules, CTRL + D to exit node.
3) _ means previous result
4) String. TAB (for all String methods)

fs module - file system module is used to read/write data from file system, this modules allows JS code to access file system in the computer.
synchronous/blocking way - readFileSync, writeFileSync
asynchronous/non-blocking way - readFile, writeFile -> callback function has err, data as arguments

Since node.js is a single threaded runtime, it is Synchronous. 
In order to make node.js asynchronous, call back functions are used. 
Callback functions let the code continue with next line of execution and callback function is executed when the initial task is completed. 

http module - this is for creating a server to listen to requests and provide a response. 
create server and then user it so - http.createServer() -> callback function has req, res as arguments

routing - Usually done using express, can be done using a node module called url
url module - used to route traffic to different endpoints/resources. req.url

__dirname - location of the file where __dirname is called. Provides relative path option dynamically.
./ - gets the directory path where node is run.
