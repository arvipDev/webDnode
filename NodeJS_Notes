Node.js is an event driven, non-blocking I/O model, single threaded javascript runtime that used Google's V8 engine to run javascript code on the server.

fs module - file system module is used to read/write data from file system, this modules allows JS code to access file system in the computer.
readFileSync, writeFileSync

Since node.js is a single threaded runtime, it is Synchronous. 
In order to make node.js asynchronous, call back functions are used. 
Callback functions let the code continue with next line of execution and callback function is executed when the initial task is completed.
